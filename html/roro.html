   <h1>What is RORO ship and how it works?</h1>
   <p>Person A: What exactly is a RoRo ship? <br>

    Person B: A RoRo ship is a type of cargo vessel designed for transporting wheeled cargo. Instead of using cranes to load and unload, vehicles drive directly onto the ship's decks using built-in ramps. <br>
    
    Person A: That sounds efficient! How do they load vehicles onto the ship?<br>
    
    Person B: Vehicles are driven up ramps, either from the dock or via specialized terminal equipment. Once inside, they're parked on decks that can often be adjusted in height to accommodate different sizes of vehicles. Workers secure them in place to prevent movement during the voyage. <br>
    
    Person A: What about discharging them at the destination?<br>
    
    Person B: The process is reversed. Workers release the securing mechanisms, and vehicles are driven off the ship via ramps, which connect to the port. Discharging can be very fast if the port facilities are well-organized. <br>
    
    Person A: Are there different types of RoRo ships?<br>
    
    Person B: Yes! There are pure car carriers (PCCs) and pure car and truck carriers (PCTCs) for vehicles, as well as RoPax ships that combine vehicle transport with passenger accommodations. Some RoRo vessels also carry containers on their top decks. <br>
    
    Person A: What challenges do they face during loading and unloading?<br>
    
    Person B: The main challenges include ensuring vehicles are loaded in a way that balances the ship, securing vehicles properly to prevent damage, and managing traffic flow efficiently on the ship and at the port. Weather can also affect operations, especially during ramp usage. <br>
