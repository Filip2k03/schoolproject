    <h1>What is cotainer ship and how it works?</h1>
    <h2>A container ship (also called boxship or spelled containership) is a cargo ship that carries all of its load in truck-size intermodal containers, in a technique called containerization</h2>
    <p>
        <h2>What they are:</h2><br>
        Container ships are large, fast cargo ships that transport freight in standardized containers. They are also known as boxships or containerships. <br><br>
        <h2>What they carry:</h2><br>
        Container ships carry most of the world's non-bulk cargo, including manufactured goods and products. The containers can carry non-perishable or perishable items, with the latter often being refrigerated. <br><br>
       <h2> How they work:</h2> <br>
        Containers are loaded onto the ship and stacked on the hatch covers and upper deck, as well as in cellular holds beneath the deck. The containers can be transferred from one mode of transportation to another without being opened, which improves security. <br><br> 
        <h2>How they're measured:</h2> <br>
        Container ship capacity is measured in twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU). The largest container ships can carry over 24,000 TEU. 
       <h2> How they're designed:</h2> <br>
        Container ships have features such as: <br>\
        A bridge, where the captain and crew control the ship's speed and direction 
        Cargo holds that can carry up to 200,000 tons of cargo 
        Container security systems, such as lashing systems, twist-lock systems, and towers <br><br>
        <h2>How they've changed shipping:</h2> <br>
        Containerization became a major element in ocean shipping in the 1960s. 
        How they're used in conjunction with other modes of transportation: <br>
        Goods placed in a container at a factory can be carried by road, rail, or sea, being transferred from one to another.</p>

        <h3>How they loading and discharging</h3>
        <p>Container ships are loaded and discharged using cranes and transtainers at a port: 
            Loading: <br> <br>
            Cranes lift containers from trucks or transfer containers onto the ship's deck or hold. The containers are stacked in designated slots using a pre-planned arrangement. Cell guides on the sides of the hold help ensure the containers are stacked properly. Lashing systems, locking systems, or buttress systems secure the containers to the ship. <br><br>
            Discharging <br>
            Cranes lift containers from the ship to the dockside. The containers are then placed on the quay and prepared for delivery. 
            Other equipment used in container operations includes transtainers and trucks. Transtainers are used to handle containers in the storage area, called the yard, while trucks move containers between the cranes and transtainers. </p>
