    <h1>What is Tanker ship and how it works?</h1>
    <h2>Loading a Tanker Ship</h2>
    Pre-Loading Preparations:
    
   <p> Inspect the tanks to ensure they are clean and free from residue that might contaminate the cargo.
    Conduct "ullaging," which measures the empty space in the tanks to calculate the quantity of cargo.
    Confirm the cargo compatibility with the tank coating to avoid chemical reactions.
    Loading Operations:</p>
    
    <p>Use loading arms or hoses at the terminal, connected to the ship's manifold.
    Follow a pre-determined loading plan to distribute the cargo evenly for stability.
    Use inert gas systems (IGS) to reduce oxygen levels in tanks carrying flammable cargo, preventing explosions.
    Monitoring:</p>
    
    <p>Constantly monitor cargo flow rates and tank levels to avoid overfilling or surges.
    Use temperature and pressure sensors to maintain the quality of cargo.</p>

   <h2> Discharging a Tanker Ship</h2>
<p>Pre-Discharge Steps: <br>

Plan the discharging sequence to maintain stability as cargo is pumped out.
Ensure the receiving facility (shore tank) is ready to accept the cargo.
Discharge Operations:</p>

<p>Use cargo pumps onboard the ship to transfer the liquid to the shore tanks.
Maintain a proper flow rate to avoid pressure surges in pipelines.
Strip and Clean:</p>

<p>After the bulk discharge, stripping pumps remove any residual liquid.
Cleaning might be required, especially for chemical or product tankers, to prepare for the next cargo.</p>
