    <h1>What is bulk carrier and how it works?</h1>
        <p>A bulk carrier is a type of cargo ship that is designed to transport dry bulk commodities such as grains, coal, ore, and other dry materials. These ships are typically large and have a large cargo hold that can hold thousands of tons of cargo.</p> <br> <br>
        <p>Loading conditions
            Bulk carriers load cargo in different ways depending on the type of cargo and the holds available: 
            Alternate hold loading: Heavy cargo, like iron ore, is often loaded in alternate holds. <br>
            Block hold loading: Cargo is loaded in a block of two or more adjoining holds, with the adjacent holds empty. 
            Homogeneous hold loading: Light cargo, like coal or grain, is evenly distributed across all holds. 
            <h2>Loading instruments</h2>
            A loading instrument can calculate shear forces and bending moments for any load or ballast condition.  <br>
            Communication <br>
            The captain provides the terminal with the vessel's estimated time of arrival. The terminal then provides the captain with information, and notifies the captain and port authorities of any safety concerns. 
            <h2>Loading and unloading plans:</h2> <br>
            Loading and unloading plans are kept on the ship and at the terminal for six months. </p>
